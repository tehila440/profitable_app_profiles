# profitable_app_profiles
Profitable app profiles from google play and app store
In this project we are looking at what type of app are likely to attract more users. The apps are free to download and install and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. For any given app the revenue is mostly indfluenced by the number of users of that app.

We are investigating mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store from 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Data Cleaning - correct or remove inaccurate data, remove duplicates, remove non-english apps, and remove apps that arent free.


The goal was to determine an area to introduce apps that may be profitable for borh Google Play and the App Store. The genres that appear most popular (social, gaming, communication,etc.) are heavily influenced by industry giants like Facebook, WhatsApp, Google and thus yield higher installs/average number of ratings skewing the genres to appear more popular than others. Other popular genres are outside the scope of this project and may require hiring ouside expertise. These incluse finance, health & fitness, and weather. The reference genre, although dominated by bible and dictionary.com, shows promise to be profitable in both markets. There are a lot of reference book around language and religion in the Google Play BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE genre. We could look into developing book apps for both markets. Possibilities include creating audio books for the popular books, quizzes, built in translations for religious books, prayer time apps with alarms and translations, or quotes.
